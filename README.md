Created an asset tracking system using nodemcu12E and a Gps module which can be placed on any moving object
whose live location is to be tracked.
The lat and long values are uploaded to pubnub which works on a publish subscribe model. Subscribers connected to 
this project's channel will be able to view the real time values.
